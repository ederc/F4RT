F4RT - F4 Reduction Tools
========================================================================
F4RT is a library of tools for implementing fast and efficient reduction
in F4-like Groebner basis algorithms. Thus the tools focus on the special matrix
structure appearing during Groebner basis algorithms. This structure leads to
special Gaussian Elimination steps, e.g. as presented in "Parallel Gaussian
Elimination for Gröbner bases computations in finite fields" by Faugère and
Lachartre.
Note that this library is dedicated to highly use CPU intrinsics and
parallelization methods. Thus it cannot be guaranteed to be efficient on 
or, even more, support older CPUs.
